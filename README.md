# Drum Machine
##### _A simple drum machine built with JavaScript_
***

This is the repo for a drum machine I built with React.js, CSS, and HTML5. The goal was to have 9 components that play different drum sounds - such as kicks and snares - when clicked or the corresponding keys are pressed on the keyboard.
